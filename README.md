## Stats Demo

A small dash app to showcase some randomly generated datasets and their best fit linear regressions/R2 values.
This is intended to show how the shape of the dataset impacts the R2 value.

Most of the logic is in assets/20_index.js, since we want updates to happen client side.

## Running the app

0. (optional) Create a virtual environment for the pip packages
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python dash/main.py
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser
